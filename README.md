creating a method which is an input application used to translate sign to speech conversion using CNN with high rate of accurate results.

Gesture language is very much important language among deaf and dumb people but not having highest percentage of using gesture language among general audience and creates a difference between two people while communicating. Gesture language is similar to real language having its own grammer and speech.Gesture Language changes according to different countries like having an American Sign Language (ASL) for America and British Sign Language (BSL) for british, the Indian Sign Language (ISL) is popular sign languages and these changes for different regions, the body language changes for different sign languages and having own grammer .The indian government is providing new online portal for different sign languages and creating online dictionary to educate people. Generally, in India more than 1 crore people are having hearing, dumb and deaf problems according to Census which is approx. 15 percent of the entire population. Nearly 75 lakh people are suffering from making speech problems which is approx 9 percent of the entire population. To decrease a gap and help deaf and speech impairments people, usage AI is guided with clearing problems.

We create a method which is an input application used to translate sign to speech conversion using CNN with high rate of accurate results. The implementation of proposed model contains following ways:
1.Taking an input gesture by proposed application
2.Input hand is identified.
3.Conversion of sign language to text format
4.Translation of text format to audio form i.e output
